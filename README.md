I structured the app with scalability in mind. Routes and controllers are separated for clarity. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and JWT is used for secure token-based authentication. MongoDB is chosen for flexibility. Posts are protected via middleware. Basic error handling and modular code ensures easy debugging and expansion.
